There are many ways you can customize views so that you can create a report that contains all the information you need to manage your ONTAP clusters.

Start with a default inventory page or a custom view, then customize it by adding or removing columns, changing the column order, filtering the data, or sorting on a specific column in ascending or descending order.

[NOTE]
====
You must have the Application Administrator or Storage Administrator role to manage reports.
