Reports display detailed information about storage, network, quality of service, and protection relationships, helping you to identify and solve potential problems before they occur.

You can download reports as PDF or comma-separated values (CSV) files. When you customize a view, you can save it with a unique name for future use. You can also schedule a report based on that view to run on a regular basis and share it with others.

You can manage all reports that have been scheduled from the Report Schedules page.

[NOTE]
====
You must have the Application Administrator or Storage Administrator role to manage reports.
