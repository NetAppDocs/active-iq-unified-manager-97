To access the Unified Manager UI, you must use a supported browser.

See the Interoperability Matrix for the list of supported browser versions.

For all browsers, disabling popup blockers helps to ensure that software features are displayed properly.

If you plan to configure Unified Manager for SAML authentication, so that an identity provider (IdP) can authenticate users, check the list of browsers supported by the IdP as well.
